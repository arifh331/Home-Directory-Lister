# **Home-Directory-Lister**

This is a simple program that lists all the contents of your home directory to your

terminal or command prompt!

It is a cool short program that replicates the effect of -l ~ on the terminal but here it makes use of the Fork and Execve function

# **How to Use**

To use this program, you must make sure that you have GCC installed so you can compile C programs. If you do, then navigate to the folder that contains the program and then compile with &quot;gcc list\_home.c&quot;. Without the quotation marks

Now the out file should have been created so type &quot;a./a.out&quot; without the quotations.

If you had chosen to name your out file that type that name rather than a.out.

Enjoy!
